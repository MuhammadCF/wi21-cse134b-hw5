I made no changes with regards to part2,
because I already received perfect scores in both criterions. I used proper strategy for image inclusion from the previous hw, I guess the changes help me now. screenshot available for proof.

note: the part 2 was done and examined before I began part3

extra note:
I had no time to test part3 throughout, and at this point
I am ready to receive whatever result I will get.
